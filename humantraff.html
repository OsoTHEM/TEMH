    <p>Although slavery is thought to be in the past, it is well and alive. Human traffickers make millions of dollars from capturing and forcing individuals into unconsented situations.
       For those of you who don’t know what human trafficking is, human trafficking is the act of illegally transporting people from one place to another. It is a huge problem in not only Atlanta, but around the globe. From sex trafficking to labor trafficking, there is an estimation of 40.3 million victims of human trafficking globally. 81 percent of the victims are forced into labor, 25 percent are children and 75 percent of the global estimation is made up of women and girls. Over 40 thousand cases of human trafficking have been reported within the last ten years. </p>

    <p>Human Trafficking in Atlanta specifically, has grown significantly. Sources tell us that Atlanta’s busy airports, frequent conventions, and booming entertainment industry makes the city a huge target and prime location for modern day slavery. A recent sting operation in North Fulton County has led to dozens of arrests and about 160 children saved. This a small accomplishment in a large form of crime but foundations such as Exodus Road and The Abolish Foundation are working to end modern day slavery.</p>
