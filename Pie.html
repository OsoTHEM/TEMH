  <h3><p>TEMH is a website that was built to inform the people about the true crimes
    and problems around the world. This is to bring the truth and real news to those people.
    The website also helps other programs from donation to feeding programs gain more people.
    Not a lot of people know the truth and other news reporters don't share the real facts about the world's major problems.
