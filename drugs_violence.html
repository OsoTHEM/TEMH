    <p>Latin America is home to the largest percentage of violence throughout the world. Although it only makes up about 8 percent of the world’s population, it makes a up a whopping 33 percent of the world’s homicide rate. This leads to many of the latin american residents to want to flee, see refugees/immigrants for more information on this topic. These countries have booming domestic drug markets, drug dealing through homes to make ends meet. Fragments of large kingpins are scattered across Latin America and without the manpower for large drug trafficking the members of these fragments resort to more local crimes. This leads to more kidnappings and large levels of extortion.</p>
