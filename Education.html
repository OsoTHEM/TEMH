    <h3>Education is the world’s most strongest power. Many students may not know the importance with school, but in other countries schools struggle to keep their students. In most developing countries, most of the schools would be broken and provide little safety for the students. The schools would be so poor that they wouldn’t even provide tables, chairs, boards, or even paper. Most of the poverty would be in Central or South America, South Asia, or in the Philippines. In El Salvador there is a school that’s deep in the jungle, the school is only a large tent. They have old rusty chairs and broken white boards with markers they have to find around other schools. The students would struggle in the different types of weather to study. Students don’t have lunch at all and have to stay focus with their hunger.</h3>

      <p><h3>Unlike in the USA, around the world schools have not been the best for the childern, and this usually happens in developing countries. In developing countries the schools don't usually keep up with the other schools, mostly in technology or teaching ways.</h3></p>

  <p><h3>Students would often travel long distances to go to school. They would walk for miles and miles to stay there for a few hours and gain a bit of information. However, another problem would be the fact that the schools may not provide lunches. Students are badly malnorished and sometimes won't be able to focus.
    There is one situation in China where a man had built a school and only had two students. The reason why was because the school was in the mountains and not many students wanted to keep walking up and down. Yet, two students would go to school to gain education.
