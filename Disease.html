<img src=virus.jpg height="400"></img>
<p>Influenza also known as the flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus.
  The virus infects the nose, the throat and sometimes lungs.
The best prevention is getting a flu vaccine every year.
Symptoms of the virus are:</p>
<p>Fever* or feeling feverish/chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Runny or stuffy nose</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headaches</p>
<p>Fatigue (very tired)</p>
<p>Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in young children than in adults.</p>
<p>Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby.
Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."</p>
