<p>The world is covered in beautiful animals, each are special, and they are all interesting in their own way. Yet,
  there is a very short number of animals on the Earth. We have so many endangered animals and we have to protect them.In so many cases there would
  be protesting and people demanding the protection onto the animals. We never actually question why though? Why are there so many animals becoming endangered?
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The world started out beautiful, with zero polluiton, zero human damage, and zero percentage of animals becoming exitect.
  Nature was in its beauty, with exotic plants growing around the world, but of course humans had started to build ideas.
  From the the B.C and so on to the Medevil times and to now, humans have grown smarter than ever. They invented inventions, buildings, and so on.
  This is a positive effect! We are growing and thinking about the future. We want to create more and more, but then we don't think
  about the creatures around us.

<div>
<p><h3>Polar bears are beautiful white creatures that live in the arctic circle. They have white fur to help them blend in the snow to catch their prey.
  These bears have always been the top animal to see, but yet there are few polar bears around the world.
</p></h3>
<p><h3>The bears have been slowly vanishing because of global warming. Polar bears have lived on ice and snow, and because of global warming its been melting fast. The bears have been starving and had often drowned.</p></h3>

<div>
  <p><h3>Hawaiian monk seal is a adorable seal that swims far from where humans are. They live in Hawaii, but in recent studies show that these animals have been dropping population.
    Hawaiian monk seal would eat fish, however fishermen have been overfishing around the area. This was causing the seals to starve and die off.

  <p><h1>African Elephant</p></h1>
  <img src= mom.jpg height= "200" ></img>
</div>

<div>
  <p><h3>African Elephant are almost like humans. The elephant females would protect and care for their young. The family would always stick together, and if something happens the family would be there to help each other.
    However, these amazing creatures have been dying. Animal sellers would take the elephants and sell them off. Another shocking fact is that hunters would kill these animals and would remove their tusks. They would use the tusks for fashion and other things.
    Its a heart break to see amazing animals with feeling like humans to be killed in a horrible way.</p><h3>
